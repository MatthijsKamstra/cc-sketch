# CC-Sketch

CC-Sketch is a creative coding library written in Javascript via [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org).
This project started when I did a [30-days-challenge](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding) and I decided it should be open-source.

## How?

I started with a 30-day-challenge and created the base for this library. You can see the [code](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/creative-coding) I have written and see the [examples](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding/)

Creative code library and examples create with [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) (I'm currently only focussing on the JavaScript target but with Haxe that could easily change). Do you want to know more about this beautiful programming language: [README_HAXE.MD](README_HAXE.MD)!

I created a simple [example](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/cc-sketch/) in this repo, but if you need more [examples](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/creative-coding/).
