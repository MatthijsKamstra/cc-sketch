# Why = The Purpose

__What is your cause? What do you believe?__

# How = The Proces

__Specific action taken to realize the Why.__

> Apple: Our products are beautifully designed and easy to use



# What = The Result

__What do you do? The result of Why. Proof__

> Simon Sinek: Every origanization on the planet knows WHAT they do. These are products they sell or the services they offer.
